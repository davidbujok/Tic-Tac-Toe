# Tic Tac Toe - a game

This project is a part of The Odin curriculum.

## Learning objectives

Learn how to design a piece of software using Javascript modules and
factory functions. The aim of the code is to keep variables tucked inside of the modules
and factory functions and expose only these that have to be accessible from outside. 

## Game objectives

The primary objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first
player to form a line of three matching symbols (either X or O) 
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the game board. 
Achieving this objective results in winning the game.
